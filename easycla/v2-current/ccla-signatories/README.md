# CCLA Signatories

A corporate CLA signatory or CCLA signatory is someone who is authorized to sign a CCLA on behalf of their company.

If the CCLA signatory is the same person as the initial CLA Manager, then they will sign the CCLA themselves while [coordinating the CCLA signing process](../corporate-cla-managers/coordinate-signing-cla-and-become-initial-cla-manager.md).

Otherwise, if the CCLA signatory is a different person than the initial CLA Manager, then the CCLA signatory will receive an email informing them that they are designated to be an authorized signatory for a company. The CCLA signatory can [review and sign the CCLA](review-and-sign-a-corporate-cla-by-request.md) on behalf of the company.
