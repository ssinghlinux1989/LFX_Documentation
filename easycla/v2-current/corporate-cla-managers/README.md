# Corporate CLA Managers

A CLA Manager is the person who manages the list of authorized contributors, and other aspects of their company's CCLA.

Before a CCLA is signed, there is not yet an official "CLA Manager". Someone from the contributing company will be responsible for [coordinating the CCLA signing process](coordinate-signing-cla-and-become-initial-cla-manager.md). That person will become the initial CLA Manager after CCLA is signed.

The person who will become the initial CLA Manager is responsible for:

* [Coordinating the CCLA signing process](coordinate-signing-cla-and-become-initial-cla-manager.md)

After the CCLA is signed, a CLA Manager of the company is responsible for:

* [Approving contributors](approve-and-manage-contributors.md)
* [Adding or deleting other CLA managers](add-or-delete-cla-managers.md)
