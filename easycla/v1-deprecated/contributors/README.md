# Contributors

As a contributor, you must sign CLA document before you can contribute to a repository. EasyCLA lets you sign CLAs from within a pull request. After you sign a CLA or sign a confirmation of association with your company, the status of your pull request is updated and you can contribute.

You can contribute on behalf of a company or contribute individually by doing one or both of the following tasks:

* ​[Confirm your association with a company that has a signed Corporate Contributor License Agreement](corporate-contributor.md). You write code for your employer and contribute this code to a project on your employer's behalf.
* ​[Sign an Individual Contributor License Agreement](individual-contributor.md). You are contributing code on your own behalf (code that you write on your own time, and not for an employer or using your employer’s facilities or equipment).

**Important:** You should not submit a contribution under an Individual CLA if that contribution is done using time and/or material resources belonging to your company. Instead, you should contribute it under a Corporate CLA signed by your company.
