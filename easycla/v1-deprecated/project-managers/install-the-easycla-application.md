# Install the EasyCLA Application

The EasyCLA Application installation process connects GitHub to the CLA Management Console. After you complete installation, you must [configure the repositories to enforce CLA monitoring](add-github-repositories-to-cla-monitoring-or-remove-them-from-cla-monitoring.md).

**To Install the EasyCLA Application:**

1\. [Sign in](sign-in-to-the-easycla-management-console.md) to the CLA management console.

2\. Click a project of interest.

3\. Click **CONNECT GITHUB ORGANIZATION**.\
The Add GitHub Organization dialog appears and lets you specify the GitHub organization.

Connecting your GitHub organization will let you enable EasyCLA checks on that organization. If you already have a CLA process in place, go to the [Linux Foundation Support Center](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/theme/portal/4/create/143), fill the form, and click **Create** to file a ticket to describe your particular needs, and import your existing CLAs.

4\. Enter your organization name in the GitHub Organization URL field. The URL automatically appends the name. Click **CONNECT**.

**Result:** The Connect LF CLA App to GitHub Organization dialog appears.

The GitHub organization name value is case-sensitive—make sure that the name you enter matches the case of your GitHub organization name exactly.

5\. Read the instructions and click **INSTALL THE GITHUB CLA APP**.\
​The EasyCLA Application opens in GitHub

6\. Click **Install** on the EasyCLA Application.

7\. Select one or more repositories and assign permissions. Click **Install**.

The CLA Management Console appears and the GitHub Organizations pane shows the organizations and the repositories that the EasyCLA Application is authorized to monitor.

{% hint style="warning" %}
* _To delete an organization from monitoring, click **DELETE** next to the organization that you want to delete. A confirmation dialog appears. Click **DELETE**. You must also_ [_Uninstall LF CLA Application for Your Organization_](uninstall-the-easycla-application.md) _that you installed in Step 5._
* A message informs you that your project needs a CLA group. A CLA group defines one or more CLA types that contributors must sign.
* If the EasyCLA Application is not connected to GitHub properly, an error message appears under the organization name: Not Configured. Please connect the CLA App to the Github Org. Click the **message link** to return to Step 4.
{% endhint %}

8\. Repeat Steps 2 through 7 to connect as many organizations as you want.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** _To enable a CLA check on a repository, you must configure a GitHub repository or add a Gerrit instance. Simply adding an organization to the project does not enable the CLA check for any CLA groups._
