# EasyCLA Status is not Updated in Contributor Console

When corporate contributors are added to the approved list or they complete CLA signing process, the CLA status still remains **Not Covered** for GitHub, and shows **No Contributor Agreement** for Gerrit while submitting change.

#### Solutions: <a href="#solutions" id="solutions"></a>

#### For GitHub <a href="#for-github" id="for-github"></a>

After you are added to approved list, you must acknowledge company contribution or sign ICLA if your CLA requires you to sign individual CLA for getting full authorization to contribute.

#### For Gerrit <a href="#for-gerrit" id="for-gerrit"></a>

Navigate to Gerrit window, sign out and sign in again, and then submit a change. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-M2DCN9UgoRgMEkgnLyP%2F-MUINUiyLM\_NbydykPGA%2F-MUJa11MIW3AXWSYG-tS%2Fsignout%20gerrit.png?alt=media\&token=98ed7f9d-14ee-4015-9c48-0d87294a15ad)
