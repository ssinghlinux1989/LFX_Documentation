# CLA Management Console Data Does Not Load

The CLA Management Console data may not load due to a bug in the Auth0 implementation. This is a sample sentence.

**Solution:**

1. On a Chrome window, open developer panel by typing **command + option + i**. for mac, and **ctrl + shift + i** for windows.
2. Select the **Application** tab.
3. Click **Clear storage** under Application in the left pane.
4. Select **Clear site data** from the bottom of the developer console.
5. Sign out of the CLA Management Console.
6. Sign back in.

If the issue persists, try using an incognito browser window.
