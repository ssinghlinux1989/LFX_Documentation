# Toggle Between Crowdfunding and Mentorship

Each crowdfunding card is visible on both Crowdfunding and Mentorship for the following reason:‌

* **Financial Information** The Crowdfunding platform displays a project's financial information, including the total amount of funds donated to the project and how the funds are distributed.
* **Mentorship Program** By offering paid mentorships, projects are able to provide mentees with opportunities to learn from experienced open source contributors as a segue to get internship and job opportunities after successful completion of the mentorship program.

You can toggle between Crowdfunding and Mentorship to gain an insight into the project's financial and mentorship details.‌
