# Sign in with LinkedIn

You can use your LinkedIn login credentials to sign in to the protected Linux Foundation service instead of creating an LF account. The first time you sign in, you will enter your LinkedIn credentials to authenticate your LinkedIn account. Subsequent logins will not require you to enter the credentials‚è§you will simply click the **LinkedIn** icon to sign in. This one-click approach simplifies your login process.
