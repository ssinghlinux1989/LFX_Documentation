# Sign in to Your Account

To access the Linux Foundation's tools, you must sign in using your LF account credentials. If you already have an LF account, use your credentials to sign in. If you just [created a new account](../create-an-account.md), follow these steps:

1\. On the **Sign In** window, enter your SSO account credentials and click **SIGN IN**.

2\. The Single Sign-On service allows users to authenticate with social and external authentication providers instead of a username and a password.

3\. When using an external authentication provider, you will be prompted to create a username if you don't have an existing username.

4\. If you create your LF account by signing in with an external authentication provider, the Linux Foundation will map your LF account to the external login.
