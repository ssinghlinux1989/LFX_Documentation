# Attendance

This dashboard shows the comparison between the _total number of individuals who have registered for the webinars_ and the _total number of individuals who have attended the webinars_ during the selected time period.

The multi-colored bar graph shows the registrants and attendees of the webinars. Hover over graph points of a colored graph to view the number of registrants or attendees of the webinars in that particular month.

The annotation block for each colored graph shows:

* The total number of registrants and attendees for each graph, respectively.
* The increment or decrement rate change in the number of registrants and attendees during the selected time period compared to the previous time period.
