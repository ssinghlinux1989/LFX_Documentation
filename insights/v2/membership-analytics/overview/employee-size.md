# Employee Size

The dashboard shows a doughnut chart that displays the segregation of the organizations based on their employee strength. You can analyze the active memberships of organizations by their current employee strength.

{% hint style="info" %}
* If the organization's employee strength is less than 100, then the organization is considered small.
* If the organization's employee strength is between 100 and 999, then the organization is considered medium.
* If the organization's employee strength is greater than 1,000, then the organization is considered large.
{% endhint %}

The center of the donut chart shows:

* The total number of active members.
* The rate of change in the number of active members during the selected time period compared to the previous time period.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the data from the previous period is unavailable or cannot be calculated, then do not show the percentage change in the center of the donut chart.
{% endhint %}
