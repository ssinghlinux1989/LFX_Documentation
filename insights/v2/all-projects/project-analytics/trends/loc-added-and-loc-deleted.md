# LOC Added and LOC Deleted

The dashboard is the same as the LOC added and deleted metric from the Global Project Trends dashboard. Unlike the projects trend that gives data for all the projects in the Linux Foundation, this dashboard provides a statistical analysis of the selected project and sub-project data.

For more information, see [LOC Added and LOC Deleted](../../../project-trends/loc-added-and-loc-deleted.md).
