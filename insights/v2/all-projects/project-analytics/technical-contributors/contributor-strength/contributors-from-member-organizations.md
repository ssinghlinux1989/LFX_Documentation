# Contributors from Member Organizations

The dashboard shows a doughnut chart that displays the analysis of affiliated contributors by their affiliations to member and non-member organizations.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the case of a sub-project, the membership affiliation is based on the parent project. Hence, if an organization is a member of the parent project, they are also members of sub-projects.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If the project (group or standalone) does not have active members but the contributing organizations have active LF membership, they are not considered as members of the current project. Meaning this chart only represents active members for the selected project or project group.
