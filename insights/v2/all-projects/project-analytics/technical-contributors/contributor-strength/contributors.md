# Contributors

The dashboard shows the total number of unique pull request contributors across all monitored repositories during the selected time period. A unique contributor is someone who performs multiple activities but is counted as one.

{% hint style="info" %}
For the current release, GitHub, Git, and Gerrit are the data sources used to calculate contributors across all monitored repositories during the selected time period.
{% endhint %}

Pull request activities include PRs submitted, comments, reviewed (review comments + approved + requested changes), merged, and rejected.

Using the bar chart, you can analyze the following data:

* Total contributors for the selected time period and the percentage change.
* Total number of submitters for the selected month. Hover over the graph to see the total number on the bar.

To analyze the PR contributor dashboard, click CONTRIBUTOR LEADERSHIP at the bottom of the chart that takes you to the **Community Management > People** dashboard.
