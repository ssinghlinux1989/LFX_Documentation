# Unaffiliated

The Unaffiliated dashboard shows a statistical analysis of contributors who are not affiliated with any organization or whose organization affiliation is unknown.&#x20;

To learn more about unaffiliated contributors, see [common-terms](../../../../common-terms.md#corporate-contributor-or-affiliated-contributor).

Using the bar chart, you can analyze the following data:

* Total unaffiliated contributors for the selected time period and the percentage change.
* Total number of unaffiliated contributors for the selected month. Hover over the graph to see the total number on the bar.

To analyze the unaffiliated contributor dashboard:

1. Click CONTRIBUTOR LEADERSHIP at the bottom of the chart that takes you to the **Community Management > People** dashboard.
2. Select the pre-filtered time period.
3. Select the project and **Technical Contribution** as the activity cohorts and **Active** as the people cohort.
4. The CM dashboard in this case will only show contributors with missing affiliations.
