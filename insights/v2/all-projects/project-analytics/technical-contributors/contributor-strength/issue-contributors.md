# Issue Contributors

The dashboard shows the total number of unique submitters and assignees across the monitored issue management tools during the selected time period. A unique contributor is someone who performs multiple activities but is counted as one. &#x20;

The Issues activity includes issues from a repository, an item in a task list, a note in a project, a comment on an issue or pull request, and a specific line of code.

Using the bar chart, you can analyze the following data:

* Total issue contributors for the selected time period and the percentage change.
* Total number of submitters for the selected month. Hover over the graph to see the total number on the bar.
