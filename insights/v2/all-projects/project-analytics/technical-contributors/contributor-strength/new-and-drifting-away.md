Click **Contributor Acquisition** at the bottom of the chart that takes you to the **Technical Contributors > Contributor Acquisition** dashboard pre-filtered for the time period selected and the project.

### Drifting Away

The bar chart shows the data of the drifting away contributors who were active in the last year but did not contribute across commits, PRs, or issues in the last 6 months.

The annotation block shows the average count of drifting away contributors in percent increase or decrease compared to the same metrics for the previous period. The percentage increase or decrease is calculated for the same time period by comparing the drifting contributor count at the start and end of the selected time period.

Click **Contributor Leadership** at the bottom of the chart that takes you to the The  **Community Management > People** dashboard pre-filtered for the time period selected, the project and **Technical Contribution** as the activity cohort and **Drifting Away** as the people cohort.
