# Developers Engaged in Multiple Projects

The dashboard shows the analysis of technical contributors by cohorts. The 6 point radar charts show the data of contributors who are actively contributing to only a single project and those who are contributing to multiple projects.

{% hint style="info" %}
A contributor is said to be active in multiple projects when they are contributing to any other project within the same project group or outside of the project group during the same time period selected.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Contributing to **more than one repo** under the same project is **not considered** as contributing to multiple projects.
{% endhint %}

Hover over the chart points to see the total number of the contributors engaged in one or multiple projects.
