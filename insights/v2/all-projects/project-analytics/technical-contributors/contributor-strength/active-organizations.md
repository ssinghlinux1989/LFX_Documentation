# Active Organizations

The dashboard shows a doughnut chart that displays the top 10 organizations by the number of technical contributions across commits, pull requests, and issues. Hover over the colored chart to view the organization's total technical contribution and the percentage values.

The metric in the center of the donut chart shows the total number of active organizations with a percentage increase or decrease compared to the previous period.

To analyze the unaffiliated contributor dashboard:

1. Click CONTRIBUTOR LEADERSHIP at the bottom of the chart that takes you to the **Community Management > Organization** dashboard.
2. Select the pre-filtered time period.
3. Select the project and **Technical Contribution** as the activity cohorts and **Active** as the people cohort.
