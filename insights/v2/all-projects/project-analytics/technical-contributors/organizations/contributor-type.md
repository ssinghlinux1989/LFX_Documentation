# Contributor Type

The chart combines two data sets with a line chart that helps you compare the total number of active contributors affiliated with organizations compared to independent developers.&#x20;

On the chart, you can analyze the following data:

* Hover over the chart to see the comparison between corporate contributors and independent contributors for the selected month.&#x20;
* The annotation box shows the percent change value of the total corporate and the total independent compared to the previous period.
