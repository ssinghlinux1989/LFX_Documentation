# New vs Existing and Drifted Away

The dashboard shows the following two matrices:

If you want to go back to the dashboard from any other screen, simply click the tab on the **Dashboard** to toggle between dashboards.

### New vs. Existing

The chart combines two data sets with a line chart that helps you compare the count of the total number of organizations that were identified to be participating in the project for the first time with those organizations that have been participating since before the selected time period.

On the chart, you can analyze the following data:

* Hover over the chart to see the new organizations vs. existing organizations for the selected month.&#x20;
* The annotation box shows the percent change value of the total new organizations and the total existing organizations compared to the previous period.

{% hint style="info" %}
An organization qualifies to be a new organization if either all its employees (contributors affiliated with this organization) are first-time contributors or if this organization was newly affiliated (contributors moving to a new company) during the selected time period.
{% endhint %}

### Drifting Away

The bar chart shows the total number of organizations whose employees are identified as drifting away and have not participated in any technical activity since the last 6 months but have been active at some point in the last 1 year.

On the chart, you can analyze the following data:

* Hover over the chart to see the drifted away organizations for the selected month.&#x20;
* The annotation box shows the percent change value of the total drifted away organizations compared to the previous period.

{% hint style="info" %}
* An organization is considered to be drifting away only if all its affiliated employees have drifted away.
* If the affiliation of an individual changes from one organization to another and the individual is still active, the old organization is considered to be drifting away.&#x20;
* When an individual ends their affiliation with an organization, the organization's contribution to that project also ends if this individual was the only active contributor from that organization in the project.
{% endhint %}
