# Employee Size

The dashboard shows a doughnut chart that displays the segregation of the organizations based on their employee strength. You can analyze the newly participating organizations by the cohorts of their current employee strength.

{% hint style="info" %}
* If the organization's employee strength is less than 100, then the organization is considered small.
* If the organization's employee strength is between 100 and 999, then the organization is considered medium.
* If the organization's employee strength is greater than 1,000, then the organization is considered large.
{% endhint %}
