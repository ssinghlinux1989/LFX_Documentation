# Contributions by Organizations

The dashboard shows a doughnut chart that displays a comparison between the technical contributions made by the new organizations and the existing organizations. You can analyze the total technical contributions across commits, PRs, and issues into cohorts of those made by new and existing organizations.

The graph also shows the total technical activities by the organizations and their percent increase or decrease as compared to the previous period.
