# Project Health Overview

The Project Health Dashboard shows a quick snapshot of the project's health by combining metrics from the [OSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) project and the [CNCF CLOMonitor](https://github.com/cncf/clomonitor) project to compute the overall best practices score for the projects.&#x20;

This feature gives you complete visibility on areas to improve in accordance with the OSS best practices guidelines for project setup, as well as the ability to monitor the project's health and take immediate action when it begins to deteriorate. This dashboard will also act as a checklist of sorts for the projects when they are ready to graduate.

Project managers, technical committee members (TSO/TOC), and community administrators/managers use this dashboard to analyze the selected projects as they progress from one stage to the next in terms of maturity to ensure they meet the foundation's standards.

This feature will be available to all LF users, i.e., anyone with the LFID.
