# Insights 2.0

There are two primary dashboards in the Insights release: Global trends and analytics for all LF projects and LF project-specific trends and metrics:

* **Global Trends** displays project performance dashboards for all the projects on-boarded by the Linux Foundation.
* Select an individual project from the All Projects page or the search bar. You will see **Project Analytics** and **Community Analytics** dashboards that provide project-specific analytical data.

{% hint style="info" %}
**The Organization Contribution Index** and the **Project Trends** dashboards are accessible without signing in. However, you must sign in to the portal to view all other global and project-specific dashboards.
{% endhint %}

The following **Global** dashboards are applicable to all the projects onboarded to LFX Insights::

* ​[Organization OSS Index](<../../../.gitbook/assets/organization oss index>): You do not need to sign in to view the dashboard. You can search for a specific project and view the contribution details of that project.
* ​[Project Trends](../../../.gitbook/assets/trends): This is the landing page for Insights. Sign-in is not required to view details.

The following project-specific dashboards are displayed after you select a project from the _All Projects_ list:

* **Project Analytics:** Trends (project specific), technical contributors, code velocity, and code base.
* **Community Analytics:** Navigate to **Community Analytics > People** to view the contributor management dashboard. Community managers can use this dashboard to view and make necessary changes to the profiles and identities of technical contributors within their community.
