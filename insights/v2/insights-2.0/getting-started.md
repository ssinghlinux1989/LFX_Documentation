# Getting Started

**Access LFX Insights**

To use the new Insights user interface, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Insights](https://insights-v2.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) login page and log in if you have an existing LF account. For the next several weeks, you can still view your project in the former version of Insights and toggle between versions as you get your project teams engaged in the new version.![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/new version.PNG>)
2. Once you are logged in, you will see **Project Trends** as the default landing page**.**

1. In the left-hand navigation, click any dashboard that you want to open in the category; once it expands, click on it to see the analytics.
2. On the dashboard, click **Filters** CTA to see the projects for the selected time. For more information, see [filter time range](../project-trends/filter-data-by-time-range.md).
