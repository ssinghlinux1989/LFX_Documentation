#### Member Organization

Member organizations (also called members) are the organizations that join the Linux Foundation or any project of the Linux Foundation, such as Hyperledger, LFX Networking, CNCF, and so on.

#### Dashboard

A dashboard is a digital tool that displays data and metrics in a visual format to provide a quick overview of key information. Dashboards are commonly used in business settings to monitor performance, track progress toward goals, and identify trends. They typically include charts, graphs, tables, and other visualizations that make it easy to understand complex data. Dashboards can be customized to show different types of information depending on the user's needs, and often include features like filters, alerts, and drill-down capabilities. By providing a clear and concise view of critical data, dashboards help users make informed decisions and take action based on real-time information.
