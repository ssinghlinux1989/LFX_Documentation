### Trainees by Geography

An interactive **Geo Locations** dashboard presents the geographical distribution of trainees and their drop rate. The Geo Location dashboard shows a map of the world combined with a heat map. The darker shade of color indicates a higher value for the metric.

The following metrics are available for analysis on the map:

* **Trainees:** the total number of trainees enrolled from different locations.&#x20;
* **Total learners for all programs :** the percentage increased or decreased in trainee enrollment for all programs compared to the previous time.

The world map with different colors for different regions (countries) represents how many individuals participated in the webinars, by country, that were organized during the selected time period. Hover over a color or a country to view the number of individuals who attended the webinars that were conducted during the selected time period.
