# Organizations By Size

The dashboard shows a doughnut chart that segregates the organizations that are currently associated with specific learners based on their employee strength. You can analyze the newly participating organizations by the cohorts of their current employee strength.

{% hint style="info" %}
* If the organization's employee strength is less than 100, then the organization is considered small.
* If the organization's employee strength is between 100 and 999, then the organization is considered medium.
* If the organization's employee strength is greater than 1,000, then the organization is considered large.
{% endhint %}
