# Top Trainees

The **Top Trainees** dashboard shows a leaderboard of individual trainees who are actively enrolled in training programs during the time period and are selected in order by the number of enrollments.&#x20;

On this dashboard, you can see the top 10 names of the trainees, their organization names, and the number of training sessions in which they have enrolled.

{% hint style="info" %}
The analysis is done based on the following parameters for all the monitored repositories:

* The first name, last name, user name , training ID, and organization name (both known and unknown organizations) from the database.&#x20;
* **Unknown** organizations: where the training user IDs are not affiliated to any organization.
