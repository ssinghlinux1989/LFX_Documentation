As a project manager, your team uses Bugzilla for bug tracking and for project management. You are interested in getting an overview of issues and submitters in your projects. You want to see who is submitting issues (bugs).

**Do these steps:**

1. Click a **project name** of interest.
2. From the **Project Management** drop-down list, select **Bugzilla** > **Overview**.\
   A dashboard shows information about issues and submitters in Bugzilla organizations. For details, see [Bugzilla > Overview](../technical-metrics/project-management/bugzilla.md#Bugzilla-Bugzilla>Overview).
3. Use the visualizations to understand aspects of Bugzilla tracking and project management. You go to **Submitters** to see who submits the most issues and the average open days for the issues.
