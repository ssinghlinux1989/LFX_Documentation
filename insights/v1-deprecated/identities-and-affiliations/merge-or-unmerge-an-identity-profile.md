# Merge or Unmerge an Identity Profile

An identity is a record (tuple) composed of a name, email, username, and the name of the source from where it was extracted. Records are converted to unique identifiers.

Each unique identity has a profile that summarizes the user data. The profile can be linked to more than one identity and you can merge an identity to the profile.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:**

* LF Insights automatically merges a new identity to an existing profile if the new identity has the same email address and name that of the existing profile in the relational database.
* LF Insights supports names with special characters while checking for an identity:
  * Single Apostrophe (')
  * Double Apostrophe (")
  * Dejan Mijić
  * Ján Srni?ek, and so on
{% endhint %}

**To Manage an Identity:**

1. Select a **project name** of interest.
2. Click **Identities & Affiliations**.
3. Select a profile from **Top Unaffiliated Contributor** list or [search for a profile](find-a-profile.md).
4. Click a **row** that corresponds to a name of interest.
5. Navigate to **Identity Management**.\
   The profile identities are listed. Each identity shows Name, E-mail, Username, Source, and an Unmerge button.\
   **Note: Unmerge** CTA button is not displayed:
   * If there is only one identity associated with the profile
   * for the unique profile to which identities are merged
6. Continue to merge or unmerge an identity profile:
