# Identities and Affiliations

Only **Project Administrators** can view, after signing in to insights, Identities & Affiliations for their project if they have access. If you do not have access, click **Request To Edit Affiliations** from navigation bar to request for access.

{% hint style="info" %}
* Only **Project Administrators** can manage affiliations of contributors for their projects.
* Contributors who are not affiliated with any organization are counted as _Unknown_ for Insight dashboard visualizations at organization level contribution.
{% endhint %}

As a project manager, you can manage different identities, such as email address and username of each contributor for a project, and affiliate their identities with the organizations they are associated with. If a profile does not have an affiliation with an identity or organization, its contributions are not counted in various Insights dashboards. To address this problem, Affiliation Management manages contributor identities including capabilities for merging identities and other data related to them such as affiliation to organizations. [Affiliation Management identifies missing affiliations and helps you address them too.](view-and-address-the-top-unaffiliated-contributors.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** [You must request and be granted access to edit affiliations](request-access-to-affiliation-management.md) before you can manage unaffiliated contributors. After you are granted access, navigate to the project dashboard. **Identities & Affiliations** is displayed on the navigation bar beside Community Leaderboard.
