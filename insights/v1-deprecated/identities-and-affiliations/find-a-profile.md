# Find a Profile

You can search by a name or keyword to find specific profiles. The search results let you identify what data (for example, Email or Affiliations) is not provided in a profile, and that you might want to add.

**To Search a Profile:**

1\. Click a **project** of interest.

2\. Click **Identities & Affiliations**.

3\. In **Search Profiles** field, enter a **name** or **keyword** and click **Search**.

* Profile results show Name, Email, Affiliations, Bot, Country, Last Modified, and #. The following column headers require explanation:
  * Affiliations shows the name of the organization that is affiliated with the profile.
  * Number (#) shows the number of identities associated with the profile.

4\. (Optional) Continue to [Merge or Un-merge an Identity Profile](merge-or-unmerge-an-identity-profile.md).
