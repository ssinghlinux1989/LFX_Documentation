# Add or Delete an Organization Affiliation

2. Click **Identities & Affiliations**.
3. Select a profile from **Top Unaffiliated Contributors** list or [search for a profile](find-a-profile.md).
4. Click a **row** that corresponds to a name of interest.\
   Profile Information appears.
5. Navigate to **Organization Affiliation**.\
   Organizations and their corresponding enrollment dates are listed.
