# Trends

Trends dashboards provide analytics of project performance, ecosystem and [data source](supported-data-sources.md) related metrics, such as how many total contributors are contributing to your project, number of commits, total number of code backlogs, issues, and many more for a project. These performance-related data are grouped into different blocks of [_metrics_](trends.md#metrics-details).

* [Global Trends](trends.md#global-trends)
* [Project Trends](trends.md#project-trends)
* [Time-Based Data Aggregation Methods](trends.md#time-based-data-aggregation-methods)
* [Downloading a Metric Card](trends.md#downloading-a-metric-card)

You can [filter data by time range](filter-data/filter-data-by-time-range.md). For details about filtering data, see [Filter Data](filter-data/).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If you filter data by time range on Trends dashboard for a _sub project_ of a project group, then the selected Trends time range will also reflect on the _other sub projects_ of the project group.

* Total number of lines of code added and modified
* Total number of Pull Requests / Changesets submitted
* Total number of builds being monitored
* Total number of emails sent
* Total number of relevant mentions on social media channels
* Total number of issues submitted
* Total number of messages sent in different chat platforms of the project
* Total number of project relevant document pages created on confluence, and
* Total number of container images downloaded

Click the icons for each metric to view details about the metrics. **No Data** is displayed for a metric if the relevant data source is not configured for the project.

## Time-Based Data Aggregation Methods

For different time periods, different strategies are used to collect, aggregate, and visualize _Trends_ data. Depending upon the selected time period, the data are displayed with different numbers of break points, also called _buckets_. Following are the different time periods, of Trends dashboard, and the strategies used to aggregate data for each of the time period:

#### 3M:

This shows aggregated data for the last 3 months from the current date. The data are aggregated based on a specific interval in days of a month, and are displayed with 12 breakpoints (also called buckets).

#### 6M:

This shows aggregated data for last the 6 months from the current date. The data are aggregated based on a specific interval in days of a month, like it is for [3 months](trends.md#3m), and are displayed with 12 breakpoints.

#### 1Y:

This shows aggregated data for last one year from the current date. The data are aggregated monthly, and are displayed with 12 breakpoints.

#### 2Y:

This shows aggregated data for the last two years from the current date. The data are aggregated quarterly, and are displayed with 8 breakpoints.

#### 3Y:

This shows aggregated data for the last three years from the current date. The data are aggregated every 4th month, and are displayed with 9 breakpoints.

#### 5Y:

This shows aggregated data for the last five years from the current date. The data are aggregated half-yearly (every 6th month), and are displayed with 10 breakpoints.

#### 10Y:

This shows aggregated data for last the ten years from the current date. The data are aggregated on a yearly basis, and are displayed with 10 breakpoints.

#### SINCE 2000:

This shows aggregated data from the year 2000 till the current year and date. The data are aggregated yearly, but are displayed with numbers of breakpoints based on the current year. For example, if the current year is 2021, the break points will start from 2000 to 2021, showing 20 breakpoints.
