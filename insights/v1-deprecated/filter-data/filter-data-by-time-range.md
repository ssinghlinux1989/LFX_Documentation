# Filter Data by Time Range

On **Trends** dashboard, you can select a time range form the time range bar to filter data. By default, the time range value is set to last 3 years on the time range bar. For more details, see [Time-Based Data Aggregation Methods](../trends.md#time-based-data-aggregation-methods).
