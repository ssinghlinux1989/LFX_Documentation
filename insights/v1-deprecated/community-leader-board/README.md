# Community Leader Board

Community Leaderboard helps you to analyze who contributes most and adds value to your project. LFX Insights analyzes and displays different identities, such as author name, the affiliated organization name, email address, number of commits, and many more data for each contributor of a project.

**Note:** Only project managers can view email addresses of contributors.

Community Leaderboard shows an [Active Community Contributor board](active-community-contributor-board.md) table that shows details about active contributors, and lets you download the table data to a CSV file.
