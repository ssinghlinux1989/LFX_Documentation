# Code Secrets

LFX Security has collaborated with BluBracket to scan for valuable private information and non-inclusive words in open source code, we call this information “code secrets”. Unearthing code secrets has made the open source projects more secure and the code security is enhanced to a great extent by detecting and monitoring the risks thus improving the code.

## Code Secrets Detected

Code Secrets Detected donut chart provides you the number of code secrets detected in the project. It shows you various code secrets detected in the project. On click of the detected code secret, the page navigates to the Code Secret details page.

## Scanning of Projects for Code Secrets <a href="#scanning-of-projects-for-code-secrets" id="scanning-of-projects-for-code-secrets"></a>

After onboarding the projects, scanning of projects for code secrets is carried out by LFX Security platform. The LFX Security platform will scan the repositories and detect the code secrets and notifications for the selected organization or repository.

### Project Code Secrets <a href="#project-code-secrets" id="project-code-secrets"></a>

LFX Security will scan the repositories and organizations for code secrets such as passwords, JWT tokens, AWS access keys, terraform state file and non enterprise webhooks.

To access code secrets for a project or repository, perform the following steps:

1.Login to [LFX Security](https://security.lfx.linuxfoundation.org) and select the required project and click **View Dashboard**.

![View Dashboard](../.gitbook/assets/View\_Dashboard.png)

2.Select **Code Secrets** from the top menu. The Code secrets are listed under the **CODE SECRETS EXPOSED** tab.

3\. The list provides the following details related to the code secrets:

* **Detected On**- Date and time when the code secret is detected
* **Alert Type**- Type of code secret that is been detected
* **Repository** - Name of the repository which contains the code from where the code secret has been detected
* **Developer** - Name of the developer who has checked in the code in the repository
* **Status** - Status of the code secret whether the code secret has been resolved or reviewed
* ​**Take Action** - Allows you to take action on the code secrets.
