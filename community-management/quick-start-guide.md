# Quick Start Guide

Community Management (CM) is simplifying complex data for better decision-making. It tracks contributor interactions across platforms like GitHub, Git, Groups.io and Twitter, providing analytics-driven insights and identifying key contributors and organizations for effective community support.

To get started, refer to this quick start guide.

### Sign in to the CM Application

1. Visit the [ https://cm.lfx.dev/](https://cm.lfx.dev/) login page.
2. Enter your credentials (username and password). If you don't have access, raise a support ticket on the [support portal.](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/4)

### Connect Your Data Sources

To see the data flowing on your CM portal, connect a few data sources.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It is preferable to use multiple data sources; however, if you start with only one, we recommend GitHub since it has a lot of developers' data, which we enhance by adding more data points for your use.
{% endhint %}

1. Once logged in, you will see the projects to which you have access under the [**My** **Project Groups**](project-groups-page/) tab. Raise support ticket on the[ support portal.](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/4) if you do not see your project cards for your projects.&#x20;
2.  Click **Settings** button under the project group that you want to onboard

5. Once the data sources are integrated, your workspace will soon be populated with your contacts and organization pages.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Settings** CTA on the project cards is available only if you have admin access to your project. You cannot edit project settings for other project groups. If you don't see Settings button for your projects raise support ticket on the[ support portal.](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/4)
