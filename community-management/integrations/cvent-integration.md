# Cvent Integration

The Cvent integration already enabled and requiring no additional configuration, facilitates the automatic appearance of events from Cvent under the projects in **CM.**&#x20;

This is achieved through a series of steps involving data transfer from **Cvent** to LFX and, subsequently, from LFX to CM via an API.

**Steps**

1. **Data Transfer from Cvent to LFX**: Cvent sends event data to LFX.
2. **Integration between LFX and CM**: An integration has been established between LFX and CM.
3. **Data Push to CM**: The integration pushes these events from LFX to CM through an API.
4. **Data Appearance in CM**: The event data, which includes details such as attendees’ or speakers’ names, the name of the event, and the date of the registration, automatically appears under the projects in CM.
