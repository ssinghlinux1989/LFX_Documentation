# Training and Certifications

The integration for Training and Certification (T\&C) is already active, requiring no further setup.&#x20;

This integration ensures that enrollments and certifications from Thought Industries, our Learning Management System (LMS), are automatically displayed under the projects section in CM.

1. **Integration Setup**: An integration has been established between Thought Industries and CM.
2. **Data Transfer**: T\&C activities are sent from Thought Industries to CM using an API.
3. **Data Display in CM**: The T\&C activities, which include details such as the learnerâ€™s names, the names of the T\&C products learners have enrolled in or received certification for, the dates of enrollment or certification achievement, and links to the certificates, are automatically displayed under the projects section in CM.
