# What is Community Management?

**Community Management** is a Customer Data Platform(CDP) tool which collects and stores customer data from across the communities in a single database for data unification, identity resolution, analysis, and activation.&#x20;

By utilizing this tool, we can effectively identify key contributors and organizations, facilitating more efficient community support\


Key points:

* It consolidates developers' touchpoints with a company or brand.
* It captures data from community platforms, product channels, and commercial channels.

* The platform provides a unified 360-degree view of developers' engagement, their companies, and their customer journey.
