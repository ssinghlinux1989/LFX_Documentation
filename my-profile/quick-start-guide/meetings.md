One super exciting feature that you will find here is the notification of upcoming meetings and the **Join Meeting** CTA. This ensures that you never miss an important meeting.

### Upcoming Meetings

On the **My Meetings** Page, you will find all your upcoming meetings under the **Upcoming Meetings** tab. Click on the meeting to check the meeting details, such as the meeting agenda passcode, meeting links, passcode, meeting IDs, etc.

### Past Meetings

You will find all the past meeting recordings and transcripts under the **Past Meetings** tab.
