# Quick Start Guide

When you log in to [https://openprofile.dev](https://openprofile.dev/), the **Home** page is your default landing page. This is your starting point, offering a snapshot of your profile and recent activities.

On the **Individual Dashboard**, you can access **Events**, register for **visa letters**, raise **travel funding** requests, access your meeting details and host keys, manage your **email IDs**, training and certification, etc.
