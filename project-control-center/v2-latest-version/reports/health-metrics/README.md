# Health Metrics

Health Metrics provides a dashboard for all onboarded projects that shows a quick snapshot of the project's health by combining metrics from the [OSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) project and the [CNCF CLOMonitor](https://github.com/cncf/clomonitor) project to compute projects' overall best practices score.

The following are the main objectives of this feature :

* Provide visibility to the projects on areas to improve as per the OSS best practices guidelines for project setup.
* Monitor the project's health and take immediate action when the same starts deteriorating.
* Act as a checklist for the projects when they are ready to Graduate.
