# Active Membership

Dashboard provides you with a table with a list of all projects that have active memberships availed by your organization. To become an active member of an open source project, you need to purchase a membership. Various membership types are available, and you can choose one that best fits your organizationâ€™s needs

The active membership table in the dashboard provides you the following details:

* Open source project for which your organization has an active membership.
* Lists you the percentage of benefits available for different projects.
* Links to view project engagement.
