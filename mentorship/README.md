# Mentorship

Mentorship makes pairing promising open-source talent with experienced mentors easier than ever. A mentorship program is a structured relationship between a mentor and a mentee, aimed at helping the mentee achieve their personal or professional goals. Invest in building a more robust and diverse community of qualified developers and engineers.

The main goal of a mentorship program is to transfer knowledge, skills, and experience from the mentor to the mentee in order to help the mentee grow and develop in their personal and professional lives.
