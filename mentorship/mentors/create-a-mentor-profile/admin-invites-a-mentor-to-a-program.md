# Admin Invites a Mentor to a Program

The **Program Admin** can invite a mentor to volunteer for a mentorship program by adding her as a mentor. When the admin adds a mentor, the mentor receives an email notification from LF Engineering letting her know that she's been added and asking her to [create a mentor](../../mentees/create-a-mentee-profile.md) profile if she doesn't have one.

If a mentor already has a profile on LFX Mentorship, there is no action required, unless she wants to remove herself from the program. Below is a screenshot of the email that the mentor receives after being added by the program admin.

Mentors can remove themselves from a program by navigating to their profile and selecting **Remove From Program** CTA next to the program name they want to be removed from.
