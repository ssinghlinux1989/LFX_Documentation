# Evaluations

Mentee evaluations are conducted three or four times throughout the duration of the mentorship program in order to provide mentees with feedback on their progress. Depending on the program, your mentor may choose to have 1:1 check-ins, virtual meetings or written evaluations.

Only after receiving a satisfactory evaluation, mentees can submit an Expensify report to receive stipends.

**Note:** Mentees are also asked to share their experience, provide feedback and suggestions at the end of the mentorship so that Linux Foundation can make improvements to program. \\
