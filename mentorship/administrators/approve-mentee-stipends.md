# Approve Mentee Stipends

After mentees submit their Expensify reports, as described in [Submit Expensify Report to Receive Mentorship Stipend](../mentees/submit-a-report-to-receive-a-mentorship-stipend.md), you (administrators) receive an email from Expensify. Open the email, and click **Approve** in the email to navigate to the Expensify page to approve or decline the report.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Ensure not to overpay or underpay stipends based on a mentee's geographical location. To know more about stipend amounts allocated to mentees based on their geographical locations, see [Total Stipend Amount](../mentee-stipends/total-stipend-amount.md).
{% endhint %}

### Conditions applicable to Decline a Report:

You can decline a report if:

* Mentee accidentally files wrong amount. For example, if the total stipend to be paid to a mentee is $3000 which is paid in two halves, i.e. $1500 each, but the mentee files directly for $3000 in the first half.
* Mentee does not complete the tasks assigned to them.
