# Platform Overview

The Mentorship Platform facilitates a structured remote learning environment for new open-source developers. It is a valuable tool for individuals who want to grow and develop in their personal and professional lives because it gives them access to the knowledge, skills, and experience of someone more experienced.&#x20;

Experienced project maintainers and contributors use the platform to mentor aspiring individuals and help them become contributors to the open-source community.
