# Mentee Evaluations

Mentee evaluations are conducted two to four times throughout the duration of the mentorship program in order to provide mentees with feedback on their progress.

Depending on the mentorship program, program admins may choose to have 1:1 check-ins, written evaluations, or virtual meetings with your mentees. Mentors work directly with the program admin to find out how the evaluations should be conducted and submitted.

Only after receiving a satisfactory evaluation, mentees can submit an Expensify report and receive their stipend. \\
