# Start Mentoring

Mentoring can be enlightening for you. It gives you an opportunity to learn many aspects of this training program, such as understanding people from a diverse background across the globe, communicating in a general tone so that mentees who have English as a second language can understand easily, handling tough situations when something odd pops up in the middle of the program, and many more.
