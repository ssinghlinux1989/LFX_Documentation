# Getting Started

Apart from adding new developers to the open source community, the Linux Foundation Mentorship program is about adding value to open source projects, by sustaining the health of open source communities. The mentorship program can achieve great success by providing high quality learning experiences to mentees. So, mentors and participating organizations play an important role in delivering quality experience to mentees by providing timely proper guidance, and discussing project milestones, deliverables, and taks with mentees.
